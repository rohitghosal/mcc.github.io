                                One of the promising youngster in the team and currently playing a crusial role in balance. This medium pace bowler keen to make
                                batsmen uneasy with line and length. Supports the middle order with fine batting skills and definite fielder.

                                This marked player is absolutely clueless with his game. He is power-pack of batting bowling fielding.
                                 Once saying "Catches wins the matches" he does so. Safest hand of the team. Great to see him in the field agingst the gravity.

                                He is good with his special type os skills. This youngster keeps improving day by day. A handy batsman in every position
                                of the team. Skilful and ardent, amorous but unnautical. Good to see this right-handed batsman and occasional off break bowler
